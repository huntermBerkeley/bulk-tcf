/* pseudocode for the bulked power-of-two-choice hashing

- The main idea is to use the sorted lists to generate an expected fill each bucket
	* Each item can then compare between it's expected fills and pick the lower bucket
	* This will act as a heuristic that will always overshoot the expected fill
	* Further testing is needed to determine if this is a viable approach and/or affects variance
