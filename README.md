# Bulk TCF

The Bulk TCF is a variant of the quotient filter that sorts the list of input keys, allowing it to have higher throughput for insertions as we can write entire cache lines simultaneously.

This codebase is deprecated, an up-to-date version can be found at https://github.com/saltsystemslab/gpu-filters.
